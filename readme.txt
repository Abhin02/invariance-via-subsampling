In this work, we used a workstation with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-Core Processor (128 threads in total) with 256 GB RAM and 2x Nvidia RTX 3090 GPUs. However, our simulations only used the CPU resources of the workstation.

Here is an organization of the different folders and files attached -- 

1 instructions.txt -- This file provides all the instructions to reproduce our results. More specifically, it contains (a) a list of all the libraries required, (b) the inputs taken by different code files, and (c) the commands required to reproduce the figures.

3. src -- This folder contains all the code files as well as a folder containing the datasets. Please see instructions.txt for more details.
